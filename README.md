# Pat's website!!!

Hey hey, this is where at least the nextjs/javascript portion of
my website is built from. Other parts of my website that may use
Dash or Flask will likely be hosted/repo'd elsewhere. Hopefully
I've been proactive and linked them below.

Also note this project uses yarn as its project manager. And
if anyone out there is using Mantine components this repo also
demonstrates how to alter the components to use nextjs's hooks,
i.e. Link, Image, etc.
